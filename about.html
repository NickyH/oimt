            The initiative management tool provides a central portal for capturing, assessing and implementing new business initiatives within Downer. New initiatives can be raised by Downer employees, suppliers or contractors. Once an initiative is captured in the system it will go into the ideas register where it will undergo a process of assessment. Any ideas that are raised as part of an approved business plan will bypass the decision-making process and progress directly to the project setup phase.
