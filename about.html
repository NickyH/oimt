    The initiative management tool provides a central portal for capturing, assessing and implementing new businss intiatives wth Downer. New initiatives can be raised by Downer employees, suppliers or contractors. Once an initiative is captured in the system it will go into the ideas register where it will undergo a process of assessment. Any ideas that are raised as part of an approved business plan will bypass the decision-making process and progress directly to the project setup phase.
    <br>
    Once you have entered the required details for a new intiative, you will receive an email confirming that your idea has been submitted. This email will provide a summary of your idea, as well as details about the assigned idea assessment contact. If and when any change to the initiative status occurs you wll receive updates by email to keep you informed of the progress of your initiative.
